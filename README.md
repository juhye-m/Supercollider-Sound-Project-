# The Sound Project written in Supercollider

What would the value of a word sound like if all of its characteristics were solely manifested as sound? 
I sent out a mass survey, asking people to choose a word and describe its sound. 
For example, mugs are clunky and somewhat dissonant but still warm and comforting. 
After compiling all of these inputs into a library of words and their descriptions, I wrote some short musical pieces with new synthdefs I programmed in SuperCollider in an attempt to capture their descriptions as audio.

A work in progress.
